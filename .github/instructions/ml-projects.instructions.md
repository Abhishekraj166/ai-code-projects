# Machine Learning Project Instructions

When working on machine learning projects in this repository:

## Model Development
- Always start with data exploration and visualization
- Implement proper train/validation/test splits
- Use cross-validation for model evaluation
- Document feature engineering decisions
- Include baseline model comparisons

## Code Structure
- Separate data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- Create reusable preprocessing pipelines
- Implement model checkpointing and saving
- Include hyperparameter configuration files

## Experiment Tracking
- Log all experiments with parameters and results
- Save model artifacts and evaluation metrics
- Include confusion matrices and performance plots
- Document failed experiments and lessons learned

## Best Practices
- Use reproducible random seeds
- Validate data quality and handle missing values
- Implement proper error handling for data issues
- Include data distribution checks
- Monitor for data drift in production scenarios
