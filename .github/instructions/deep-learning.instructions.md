# Deep Learning Project Instructions

When working on deep learning projects:

## Model Architecture
- Start with simple architectures and add complexity gradually
- Document layer choices and activation functions
- Include model summary and parameter counts
- Comment on architecture design decisions

## Training Process
- Implement proper data augmentation strategies
- Use appropriate loss functions and optimizers
- Include learning rate scheduling
- Monitor training and validation metrics
- Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting

## Data Handling
- Create efficient data loaders and pipelines
- Implement proper data preprocessing and normalization
- Handle class imbalance appropriately
- Validate data shapes and ranges

## Performance Monitoring
- Track training loss, validation loss, and metrics
- Create learning curves and visualizations
- Monitor for overfitting and underfitting
- Log GPU/memory usage for optimization

## Model Deployment
- Save model weights and architecture separately
- Include model inference examples
- Document input/output formats
- Test model performance on new data
